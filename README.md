Mod for Minecraft. Feel free to help because I'm new to this.

If you feel that my textures are lack-luster (which I know they are because I am focused on coding the mod), please contact me.

So far what I am doing is remaking a mod I made back in 1.4.7 with Modloader.

I planned back then to do more with it but Modloader was very limited in what I could do without modifying base class files.

The original premise for the mod was to do with my friend's obsession with cows and Space Core from Portal 2.

He called them Space Cows.
